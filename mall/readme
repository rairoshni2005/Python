Title: Python Mall System

Description:

The Python Mall System is a command-line application that simulates the shopping experience within a virtual mall environment. Users are presented with options to browse and purchase items from various departments, including clothing, food, furniture, and electronics.

Key Features:

Department Selection: Users are greeted with a menu where they can choose from different departments, such as clothing, food, furniture, and electronics.
Product Listings: Within each department, users can view a list of available products along with their prices and descriptions.
Shopping Cart: Users can add desired items to their shopping cart and view a summary of their selections, including total price and quantity.
Checkout Process: Once users have finished shopping, they can proceed to checkout, where they provide billing and shipping information before confirming their purchase.
Inventory Management: The system keeps track of available inventory for each product and updates quantities as items are purchased.
User Authentication (Optional): For added security and personalized experience, users may be required to log in before accessing the shopping features.
Implementation:

The project is implemented in Python, utilizing concepts such as object-oriented programming, file handling, and user input handling. Each department and product may be represented as objects, with methods for displaying information, adding to cart, and managing inventory.

Usage:

Users interact with the Mall System through a command-line interface, navigating menus, selecting items, and completing purchases using simple text-based commands.

Purpose:

The Python Mall System serves as a practical exercise in software development, providing experience with Python programming concepts and simulating real-world scenarios in a retail environment.
